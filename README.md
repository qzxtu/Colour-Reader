## Notes
- Hexadecimal colours are strings of 6 characters that represent colours. Every two characters represent the values of red, green, and blue, respectively. The characters can be numbers from 0 to 9 and letters from A to F.
- For example, "FFFFFF" is white, "000000" is black, "FF0000" is red, "00FF00" is green, and "0000FF" is blue.
